CyclOSM
=======

This is a [CartoCSS](https://carto.com/developers/styling/cartocss/) style
designed with cycling in mind.


[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/cyclosm/cyclosm-cartocss-style.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cyclosm/cyclosm-cartocss-style)

**Note:** This is currently a Work In Progress.


## Philosophy

CyclOSM is a new cycle-oriented render. Contrary to
[OpenCycleMap](http://opencyclemap.org/), this render is free and aims at
being more complete to take into account a wider diversity of cycle habits.

In urban areas, it renders the main different types of cycle tracks and lanes,
on each side of the road, for helping you draw your bike to work route. It also
features essential POIs as well as bicycle parking spots or spots shared with
motorbikes, specific infrastructure (elevators / ramps), road speeds or
surfaces to avoid streets with pavings, bumpers and bike boxes, etc.

The same render also lets you visualize main bicycle touring routes as well as
essential POIs when touring (emergency services, shelters, tourism, shops).


## Features

Render:

* Cycleways track, lanes, cycle-bus lanes
* Motor oneway - two way for bicycle
* Cycle routes (local, regional, national, international)
* Parking for bicycle (or motorcycle parking open to bicycle)
* Steps with bicycle friendly ramp
* Bicycle shop and repair stations
* First aid amenities : shelter, hospital, pharmacy, police station, water, food store

* Emphasis on low speed roads (<= 30km/h)
* Elevation curves and shading
* Smoothness of the roads
* Traffic calming
* â€¦
