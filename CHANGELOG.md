## [Unreleased]

* Draw crossings and traffic calming only from Z18 (was Z17 before).
* Lighter farmland color, better distinction between meadows and wood colors.
* Higher contrast for names and minor roads.
* Slightly fade footway and bridleway
* Buildings were semi-transparent, resulting in greenish buildings in wooden
    areas. This is fixed.
* No longer render tunnel waterways.
* Render bicycle routes labels above ferry routes labels.
* Fix incorrect rendering of some area labels (was appearing at one of the
    area point).
* Now rendering `highway=path` with `bicycle=designated` almost as a
    `cycleway` and if there is `segregated=yes`, then as a `cycleway`.
* Fix for missing oneway arrow on `highway=path` with a `oneway:bicycle=yes`
